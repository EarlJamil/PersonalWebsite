            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back when I was a child, my parents saw something in me. They saw that I liked to <strong><mark>dance and sing.</mark></strong> My parents said that I always snatched the mic when we were doing videoke. When they sang on the videoke, they were amazed that I always hit the notes and always got a score of 90 to 100 on the songs. At that moment, I made an oath to myself that I would use this voice and this talent to bring joy to others. As I grew older, I discovered another passion: writing. In addition to singing, <strong><mark>I found solace in writing.</mark></strong> Whether it was crafting stories, poems, or essays, writing became a way to express my thoughts and emotions. My creativity knew no bounds as I explored various genres and styles. Combining my love for singing and writing, I embarked on numerous creative projects. I developed apps with beautiful user interfaces, wrote scripts for interactive stories, and even composed original songs that are about my journey of being a teenager, and recently, my journey in my 20â€™s. As I move on to my college life, I found myself enjoying coding. When I was in highschool, I found myself enjoying my computer subject, HTML. I love to make webpages. Recently, I have been trying to <strong><mark> my coding skills.</mark></strong> Now, I am focusing on my front-end journey. Learning <em><strong>JavaScript</strong></em> and <em><strong>CSS</strong></em> has been both challenging and exhilarating. I spend hours watching videos on youtube about how to code, and creating visually appealing web pages. My coding journey is just beginning, but I am determined to master it. Singing, writing, and computing allow me to express myself in various ways, each with its distinct joy and fulfillment. All of these factors contribute to one thing: <strong><ins>creativity.</ins></strong> With that, I'd like to improve and reflect on my creativity in these areas. They've taught me the value of creativity and ongoing learning.

            <p id="hobbies"><blockquote> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><ins>Growing up, my passion for arts and crafts was deep.</ins></strong> When I was a child, my days were filled with a variety of interests that offered me great joy. Painting was a favorite pastime of mine, as it allowed me to scatter colors on a canvas and let my imagination run wild. Each brushstroke was a means of expressing my emotions and creativity. <strong><mark>Calligraphy</mark></strong> was another pastime that attracted me. The skill of writing beautifully was both difficult and gratifying. I admired the pen's flowing movements and how each stroke created lovely letters. I remembered that I always use my savings just to buy some pens and tools for it. It was wild back then, I must say. <strong><mark>Drawing</mark></strong> was another activity that I really enjoyed also. A pencil in hand, I could draw things that I have in mind. I would say that teaching myself how to draw is not easy because it requires a lot of hand strength but I managed to push through it. Moving on to another form of art which is <strong><mark>photography.</mark></strong> Whenever I see something on the street or anywhere, I always capture it. <strong><ins>Each photo has a story behind it.</ins></strong> Back then, I didn't understand why people always seemed to capture the things or places they saw, but now, I realize it's the art of noticing. Noticing things, places, and experiences holds a huge amount of value. Photography is now my favorite hobby.  It allows me to see the world through a different lens, appreciating the beauty in everyday moments. Through photography, I have learned to pay attention to the little details that make life extraordinary, and it has deepened my appreciation for the world around me. I just really adore how a device could hold a memory that could be preserved forever. All I can say is these hobbies that I have will forever be my hobbies in life.

            <p id="interest"><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are lots of things that pique my interest. First and foremost is <strong><mark>listening to music.</mark></strong> Listening to music provides me with the energy to go throughout the day. I start my day by listening to my favorite tunes. Indie pop is my genre of choice because it gives me a serotonin boost, and most of my favorite artists are in this field. The melodies, lyrics, and overall vibe of indie pop songs resonate with me, making it my go-to playlist. <strong><mark>Fashion</mark></strong> is also my favorite interest nowadays. I invest my time looking for cool/good clothes. Generally, it boosts my confidence that I know my fit is clean-looking. Also, looking for fashion statements is primarily my goal right now. I love experimenting with new styles and finding unique pieces that reflect my personality. The next one is that I am recently interested in shopping for clothes. Browsing fashion feeds and online stores for inspiration has become an interest of mine. Social media platforms like Instagram and Pinterest are treasure troves for discovering the latest fashion trends. I admire the creativity of fashion designers and influencers who push the boundaries of style.I find joy in making my wardrobe to create cohesive and stylish looks. Mixing and matching different pieces to create a unique outfit is an exciting challenge. Lastly, <strong><ins>I enjoy creating content on social media,</ins></strong> particularly on <strong><em>TikTok</em></strong>. As I mentioned earlier, I love sharing my passion for music there. I've gained some engagement and I am thrilled to say that a few of my favorite artists have acknowledged me. Interacting with them was an incredible experience. I never expected to catch their attention, but you never know what can happen. For now, <strong><mark>I will keep posting about my love of music, as it was the initial reason I started.</mark></strong>
